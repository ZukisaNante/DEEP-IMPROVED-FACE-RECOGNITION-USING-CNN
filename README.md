# DEEP-IMPROVED-FACE-RECOGNITION-USING-CNN
Trying to Improving the accuracy of CNN
---
### INTRODUCTION
> The aim here is to try and improve the accuracy of CNN in face recognition (FR).
> Some of the code used here is a credit to all CNN programmers who post their findings and tutorials and researchers who share the new findings.

### CNN Architecture

### Modifications in the code
> - CNN architecture was changed as you can see the model.summary() from the code.
> - The 7x7, 5x5 and 3x3 convolution filters pixels were changed to 7x7 for all layers.
> - The following image (Model: "sequential") shows this model. the model can go dipper but will demand a lot of training time in CPU. Still on modification to get more accuracy.
